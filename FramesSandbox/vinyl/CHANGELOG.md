# 0.5.2

Ported the tutorial to haddocks (andrewthad)

# 0.5.1

Added utilities for working with the `FieldRec` type.

# 0.5

Vinyl 0.5 combines the generality of Vinyl 0.4 with the ease-of-use of previous
versions by eschewing the defunctionalized type families and just using plain
type constructors; Vinyl 0.4-style records can be recovered in most cases in a
modular manner without baking it into the fabric of Vinyl itself.

Also new in 0.5 is a unified lens-based approach to subtyping, coercion and
projection.

# 0.4

Vinyl 0.4 is a big departure from previous versions, in that it introduces a
universe encoding as a means to generalize the space of keys from strings to
any arbitrary space. This means that you can have closed universes for your
records.
